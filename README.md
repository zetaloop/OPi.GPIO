**An experimental fork that use `gpio readall` for mapping instead of map manually.**

A drop-in replacement library for [RPi.GPIO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-gpio-python) for the Orange Pi Zero and other SBCs.
Only the basic GPIO functions are **replicated**, using sysfs: this allows the GPIO pins to be accessed from user space.

See the [documentation](https://opi-gpio.readthedocs.io) for install instructions and detailed API usage.
*Note: this documentation is not specific to this fork.*

## Installation

You must have WiringPi (WiringOP etc.) installed in your system, and be able to use `gpio readall` command.

In the virtual environment that you are using for your project, run:

`pip3 install OPi.GPIO-ex`

OPi.GPIO is now accessible like this:
```python
import OPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
# or GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# setup inputs, outputs, event detection etc as per the documentation linked above
```

## Notes

### Non-Root Access

OPi.GPIO generally needs root access, but this might be inconvenient in some cases. The official documentation has
[instructions](https://opi-gpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#non-root-access) for non-root access, but this
solution did not work correctly for me, so your mileage may vary here.

Running a Python script with `sudo` does not work correctly when a virtual environment is activated. However,
you can run `sudo venv/bin/python3 myscript.py` which will work correctly. This is my (probably not best-practices)
solution for the time being. It does not, however, allow you to run it without root entirely.

### Testing

Only tested with my Orange Pi Zero 2W and a e-Paper module (see [Waveshare_e-Paper](https://github.com/zetaloop/Waveshare_e-Paper), not finished yet)
